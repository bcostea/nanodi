======
Ndi is a small dependency injection container and tooling for .NET C# projects that are small or that do not need the complexity of bigger IOC solutions.

I built NDI back in 2009 as a pet project, learning .net, I'm reviving and enhancing it for current projects.

Ndi's goal is to be small, fast and clean.

Ndi contains:

* DI container
* micro-tooling (configuration holder, logging) 

Ndi capabilities as a DI container:

* Attributes based component configuration
* XML based component based configuration
* Auto wire components by name
* Field injection
* Constructor injection
* Scoping (with singleton and prototype scopes)
